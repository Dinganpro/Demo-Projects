Battery Draining Circuit

Project Overview

This project is a Battery Draining Circuit that discharges a smartphone battery by applying a controlled load. The circuit uses an Arduino Uno, an XL4015 buck converter, and an IRLB MOSFET to regulate the discharge process.
We have implemented a logical ON/OFF signal from the Arduino to control the MOSFET, but the battery drain effect can be increased by using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) instead of a simple ON/OFF approach.
Additionally, we are monitoring the voltage drop across the load resistor using the Arduino to observe how the battery voltage decreases over time.

Hardware Components

Arduino Uno ‚Äì Controls the MOSFET switching
IRLB MOSFET ‚Äì Acts as an electronic switch to control current flow
XL4015 Buck Converter ‚Äì Provides stable voltage to the circuit
Load Resistors (100Œ©, 1Œ© 5W) ‚Äì Creates a discharge path for the battery
1N5819 Schottky Diode ‚Äì Ensures correct current flow and protects components
Capacitor (1000¬µF) ‚Äì Helps stabilize voltage fluctuations

Working Principle

1Ô∏è‚É£ The smartphone is connected to the circuit via a USB-A connection.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The MOSFET controls the current flow from the phone‚Äôs battery to the load resistors.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The Arduino sends either a logical ON/OFF signal or a PWM signal to the MOSFET‚Äôs gate, regulating power dissipation.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Higher load = faster discharge, but to prevent excessive battery stress, the resistor values are chosen carefully.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Voltage monitoring is done by measuring the voltage drop across the load resistor using Arduino‚Äôs analog input (A0 pin).

Improvement Ideas for Faster Discharge

‚úÖ Using PWM control instead of a static ON/OFF signal for better power dissipation.
‚úÖ Increasing the load resistance in parallel to draw more current.
‚úÖ Adding active cooling to handle higher power dissipation without overheating components.
‚úÖ Implementing automatic discharge cut-off when the battery reaches a certain voltage.

How to Use

1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the smartphone to the USB-A port in the circuit.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Arduino program to monitor voltage and control MOSFET switching.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Observe the voltage drop and battery discharge behavior in the serial monitor.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Adjust resistor values or MOSFET switching logic for different discharge rates.
